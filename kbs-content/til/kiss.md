KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple stupid" (notice _no_ comma). 

Stupid does not refer to the user. To quote Wikipedia:
   > The principle is best exemplified by the story of Johnson handing 
     a team of design engineers a handful of tools, with the challenge 
     that the jet aircraft they were designing must be repairable by   
     an average mechanic in the field under combat conditions with     
     only these tools. 

   > Hence, the "stupid" refers to the relationship between the way    
     things break and the sophistication available to repair them.
