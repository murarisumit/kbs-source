In India leving charges is very easy, police system is corrupt and judical system overloaded and is mostly philiosphical because it can't do much without proper hones police system.

How much people accuse arvind kejriwal on formation of political party, but this is true if you've to bring change and government is reluctant to bring change, you've to become that change.


Imagine a distopian india, where most of them are corrupted, there is an honest voice that comes up, all it take to bar him from contesting election is just a false case and with money and so corrupted police sytem, putting in jail is not to so difficult task.
